        <h2>Career and Business Opportunities in Agriculture</h2>

        <h4>Career Opportunities:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Agriculturist – Applies knowledge of soil science, crop nutrition, pest management, and livestock care to optimize agricultural product growth and quality.</li>
            <li>Farm Technician – Uses technical skills to operate equipment, monitor crop/animal health, conduct tests, and implement production best practices.</li>
            <li>Farm Owner – Manages land planning, resource allocation, finances, and ensures compliance with industry standards for agri-crops and animal production.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Business Opportunities:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Traders – Relies on knowledge of product characteristics, storage, market trends, and post-harvest handling to deliver goods in good condition.</li>
            <li>Entrepreneurs – Builds agriculture-related businesses (processing, direct-to-consumer, supply chain) using skills in product development and value chain management.</li>
        </ul>

<h4> Agricultural tools, implements, and equipment and their uses</h4>
            <p>This covers identifying the three distinct categories of farm resources and what each is designed to do:</p>
            <ul class="category-list">
                <li><strong>Tools</strong> – Small, handheld items (<span class="example">e.g., bolo, hand trowel, pruning shears</span>) used for precise, manual tasks like cutting, digging, or trimming.</li>
                <li><strong>Implements</strong> – Larger attachments (<span class="example">e.g., plow, harrow, cultivator</span>) typically pulled by animals or machines to perform heavy field work like land preparation.</li>
                <li><strong>Equipment</strong> – Motorized or mechanized devices (<span class="example">e.g., tractor, water pump, sprayer</span>) for high-volume or labor-intensive operations such as transporting goods or applying fertilizers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Knowing their uses ensures efficient and appropriate application in farm work, which is critical for successful crop and animal production.</p><h4>Agricultural Hazards and Risks in Farm Operations</h4>
            <h4>Precautionary measures</h4>
            <p>These are proactive steps to prevent damage to tools/equipment and avoid accidents. Examples include keeping tools clean and dry after use, storing them in secure, organized spaces, checking for wear or damage before operation, and using protective guards on equipment.</p>
            <p>Precautionary measures help extend the lifespan of farm resources and maintain a safe working environment.</p>
        
        
            <h4>Safety procedures in using tools and equipment</h4>
            <p>This focuses on rules for safe operation to protect the user and others. It includes wearing proper personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, goggles, or boots; following manufacturer instructions for machines; avoiding distractions while working; and only operating equipment one is trained to use.</p>
            <p>Safety procedures are essential for reducing risks in farm operations and ensuring sustainable, responsible work practices.</p>

   <h4>Agricultural Practices in Crop Production</h4>
            <p class="section-intro">
                This section focuses on the foundational steps before and during planting – the groundwork that determines crop success:
            </p>
            <ul class="subtopic-list">
                <li><strong>Site selection:</strong> Choosing where to grow crops based on factors like soil quality, sunlight, and water access to ensure optimal growth conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Land preparation:</strong> Preparing the soil (e.g., tilling, plowing) to loosen it, remove weeds, and improve nutrient availability for seeds or seedlings.</li>
                <li><strong>Crop selection:</strong> Picking appropriate crops based on climate, soil type, market demand, or local farming goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting/Transplanting:</strong> Properly sowing seeds or moving seedlings to the field at the right time and spacing to support healthy root development and growth.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="section-conclusion">
                Together, these steps ensure crops start strong – poor planning here can lead to low yields or crop failure, so understanding each practice is critical.
            </p>

At the end of the second quarter, the learner is expected to demonstrate practical skills and proper work values in performing basic tasks related to Technology and Livelihood Education. The learner can independently perform simple procedures, use tools and materials safely and correctly, and apply knowledge in real-life situations.
Specifically, the learner is able to:
Perform basic tasks and procedures in the chosen TLE area (such as ICT, Home Economics, Agri-Fishery Arts, or Industrial Arts)
Use tools, equipment, and materials properly and safely
Follow instructions, steps, and safety rules accurately
Demonstrate good work habits such as cleanliness, cooperation, responsibility, and time management
Produce simple outputs or projects that meet given standards
Show creativity, accuracy, and efficiency in doing assigned activities</p>

The content standard section for these topics is not fully visible in the image. However, aligning with the overall Quarter Il Agriculture and Fishery Arts (AFA) framework for Grade 7 (from prior context) and the structure of this curriculum segment, the overarching content standard applies: The learners demonstrate an understanding of the concepts and skills in agri-crops and animal production - with specific focus on agricultural practices in crop production, and care and maintenance of crops.</p>

            <p>The standard also promotes appreciation of cultural and local food traditions, encouraging respect for diverse dishes and cooking methods while fostering creativity. It prepares learners for practical life skills and careers in culinary arts, food service, and hospitality, developing discipline, teamwork, and responsibility. Overall, it aims to create knowledgeable, skillful, and health-conscious individuals who can cook safely, eat nutritiously, and appreciate food culture.</p>
